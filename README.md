# 🌟 Learn Visual Python (VPython) with Jupyter Notebooks 🚀

Welcome to this curated collection of **Jupyter Notebooks** designed to help you learn and explore **VPython** in a step-by-step, beginner-friendly manner.

> ✍️ _Some notebooks are created from scratch, while others are inspired by or adapted from online sources like YouTube tutorials and blogs. All are commented thoroughly to help you understand VPython easily._

## 🎯 What is VPython?

**VPython** (Visual Python) allows you to create **3D animations and simulations** easily using Python. It's perfect for physics visualizations, simulations, and interactive environments.

---

## 🧠 Prerequisites

Before diving into VPython, you should have:
- ✅ Basic knowledge of **Python programming**
- ✅ Curiosity and enthusiasm to build visual simulations!

---

## ✅ Requirements

To run these VPython notebooks, make sure you have the following installed:

### 🔧 Software

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**

You can install Jupyter using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

 > 💡 **Note Before Using `pip`:**  
  > If you're using Python for the first time:
  >
  > ✅ Make sure `pip` is installed. It usually comes with Python 3.4+, but in case it's missing:  
  > 👉 [Official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation)
  >
  > 🛠️ Also ensure that **Python and pip are added to your system's PATH** so they can be used from the terminal or command prompt:
  >
  > - On **Windows**:  
  >   When installing Python, make sure to check ✅ the box that says  
  >   `"Add Python to PATH"` during setup.
  >
  > - On **macOS/Linux**:  
  >   Python and pip are usually in PATH by default, but if needed, you can manually add them by editing `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`.
  >
  > 🔍 To test if pip is correctly installed and in your PATH, run:
  > ```bash
  > pip --version
  > ```
  > If you see a version number, you’re good to go! ✅

📦 Python Libraries
vpython – for 3D simulations

```bash
pip install vpython
```
## 💡 Optional but Helpful
- Anaconda Distribution – includes Python, Jupyter, and many scientific packages
  <p> 🔗 https://www.anaconda.com/download </p>
  <p>Or </p>
- VS Code – better notebook experience
