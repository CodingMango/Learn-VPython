## ✅ Requirements

To run these VPython notebooks, make sure you have the following installed:

### 🔧 Software

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**

You can install Jupyter using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

 > 💡 **Note Before Using `pip`:**  
  > If you're using Python for the first time:
  >
  > ✅ Make sure `pip` is installed. It usually comes with Python 3.4+, but in case it's missing:  
  > 👉 [Official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation)
  >
  > 🛠️ Also ensure that **Python and pip are added to your system's PATH** so they can be used from the terminal or command prompt:
  >
  > - On **Windows**:  
  >   When installing Python, make sure to check ✅ the box that says  
  >   `"Add Python to PATH"` during setup.
  >
  > - On **macOS/Linux**:  
  >   Python and pip are usually in PATH by default, but if needed, you can manually add them by editing `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`.
  >
  > 🔍 To test if pip is correctly installed and in your PATH, run:
  > ```bash
  > pip --version
  > ```
  > If you see a version number, you’re good to go! ✅
