## 🎯 What is VPython?

**VPython** (Visual Python) allows you to create **3D animations and simulations** easily using Python. It's perfect for physics visualizations, simulations, and interactive environments.

---

## 🧠 Prerequisites

Before diving into VPython, you should have:
- ✅ Basic knowledge of **Python programming**
- ✅ Curiosity and enthusiasm to build visual simulations!

---

## ✅ Requirements

To run these VPython notebooks, make sure you have the following installed:

### 🔧 Software

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**

You can install Jupyter using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

📦 Python Libraries
vpython – for 3D simulations

```bash
pip install vpython
```
## 💡 Optional but Helpful
- Anaconda Distribution – includes Python, Jupyter, and many scientific packages
  <p> 🔗 https://www.anaconda.com/download </p>
  <p>Or </p>
- VS Code – better notebook experience
